                        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
                        <p>The population of Manila has grown at an alarming rate since 1970, faster than any other city. It is estimated that the density of people is roughly 12,600 per square kilometer. Thousands live in poor quality housing in the shadow of industrial plants or power stations. Smog is almost constantly hanging over the city, exacerbated by the 2.2 million vehicles that clog the streets on a daily basis. According to reports published by the World Health Organization (WHO), levels of airborne particles of lead (Pb) are three times than the acceptable figure. Concentrations of PM2.5 have also found to be unacceptably high, too. <br><br>

                        Before the COVID 19 pandemic, there were some rainy days in Manila when a thick haze would envelop the city totally obscuring the city skyline. Because this was so common place, many Filipinos accepted it as the norm. At the start of lockdown, due to the reduction in traffic and industries working, the air quality began to improve due to the lack of emissions. Many residents were reminded just how close the city is to the majestic Sierra Madre range of mountains which was now visible from the city center due to the lack of haze hanging over the city.<br><br>

                        Residents took to social media to spread photographs of sunsets over the city using the Sierra Madre as a dramatic backdrop. By following the lead set by other countries in trying to contain the spread of COVID 19, the Philippine government inadvertently improved the air quality in Metro Manila within a fortnight.<br><br>

                        Following the publication of a report conducted by the University of the Philippines’ Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology (IESM), it was seen that the levels of fine particulate matter or PM2.5 decreased by 40 per cent when compared to levels recorded in January before the enhanced community quarantine, or ECQ commenced in March. These figures were taken from instruments at the ground-level monitoring station in Quezon City, in the northern part of Metro Manila.<br><br>

                            
                        Similar findings were reported by other monitoring organizations, too. For example, Clean Air Asia, which started monitoring air pollution in the capital earlier this year, recorded a 51% to 71% decrease in PM2.5 levels in three areas of Manila for the last week of April when compared to the period before the lockdown.<br><br>
