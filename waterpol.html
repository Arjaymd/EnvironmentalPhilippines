                        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
                        <p>The Philippines, or the Republic of the Philippines, is a country comprised of 7,107 islands in Southeast Asia in the western Pacific. The country is surrounded by water: the Luzon Strait, the South China Sea, the Sulu Sea, the Celebes Sea and the Philippine Sea. According to the United Nations, uncontrolled, rapid population growth has contributed to extreme poverty, environmental degradation and pollution in the Philippines.<br><br>

                        Water pollution is a major problem in the Philippines. According to Water Environment Partnership in Asia (WEPA), 32 percent of the Philippines’ land mass — approximately 96,000 square kilometers — is used for agriculture. The primary crops are palay (rice), corn, sugar cane, fruit, root crops, vegetables and trees (for rubber). Increased population, urbanization, agriculture and industrialization have all reduced the quality of water in the Philippines.<br><br>
                            
                        According to WEPA, water pollution’s effects cost the Philippines approximately $1.3 billion annually. The government continues to try to clean up the problem, implementing fines to polluters as well as environmental taxes, but many problems have not been addressed. According to government monitoring data, up to 58 percent of the groundwater tested was contaminated with coliform, and approximately one third of illnesses monitored during a five-year period were caused by water-borne sources. In addition to this, during the dry season, many areas experience water shortages.<br><br>

                        On its website, Greenpeace reports the water pollution in the Philippines is mostly wastewater from the following sources:<br><br>

                        1.  Industrial: The metal varies according to industry — lead, mercury, chromium, cadmium and cyanide.<br><br>

                        2.  Agricultural: Organic — decayed plants, dead animals, livestock manure, soil runoff; and non-organic — pesticides and fertilizers.<br><br>

                        3.  Domestic sewage: Contains pathogens that threaten human health and life.<br><br>

                        4.  Other sources: Oil, mine or chemical spills and illegal dumping in or near water.
                            One of the most alarming things Greenpeace reports is that out of the Philippines’ 421 rivers, as many as 50 are considered dead and unable to support any but the most robust life.<br><br>

                        Greenpeace has been working to develop a solution to water pollution in the Philippines. The organization supports the Clean Production context in which the public has a right to know which toxins they are exposed to in their daily lives.<br><br>
